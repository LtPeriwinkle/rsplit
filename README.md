# rsplit
(soon to be) TUI speedrun timer written in rust\
only for linux (and theoretically OS X), as it uses [termion](https://docs.rs/termion/1.5.5/termion/) and [tui](https://docs.rs/tui/0.9.5/tui/)\
if someone out there finds real documentation on how to use tui with crossterm (other than the five lines of code on the tui link I linked) tell me where please\
I'm fairly new to rust and doing this as basically a learning exercise so feel free to tell me all the things I'm doing wrong.
